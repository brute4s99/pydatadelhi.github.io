### Guideline

`To be updated`

### Branches
 

Meilix uses an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast. 

1. **`Master`** is the development branch. It should always built.

2. **`Generator`** is a legacy branch we keep for reference for the time being. It chrooted a master branch ISO release and made changes as requested by the meilix-generator app and repackaged the customized ISO.

3. No further branches should be created in the main repository.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `master` branch. 
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
